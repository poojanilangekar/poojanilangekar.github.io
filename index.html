    <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
    <p>I am a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland</a>. I am primarily interested in distributed database management systems. I am extremely fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/">Daniel Abadi</a>.</p>
    <p>Previously, I was an engineer at Google, working on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/spanner">Spanner</a>. Prior to that I worked on <a href="https://impala.apache.org/">Apache Impala</a> at Cloudera.</p> 
    <p>I earned my MS from <a href="https://cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a> where I was a part of the <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu">CMU Database Group</a> advised by <a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo">Andy Pavlo</a>. A long while ago, I completed my bachelors from <a href="https://ceg.annauniv.edu/">College Of Engineering, Guindy, Anna University</a>.
